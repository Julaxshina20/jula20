        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">From ‘Indian’ to ‘Malaiyaha’ A call for identity recognition  </h1>
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
            <img src="a25.jpg" alt="News Image"style="width: 500px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;"> </div>
        
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">   For over two centuries, the Hill Country Tamil community has played a vital role in Sri Lanka’s social and economic landscape and has
             called the island home, yet their identity remains tied to their ancestral roots in India. With the fourth, fifth and even sixth generations
              of this community now living in Sri Lanka, there is a growing need to move away from the “Indian Tamil” identity and fully embrace the “Malaiyaha Tamil” identity. 
              Advocates argue that while there have been small steps—such as partial recognition in census classifications—the absence of a formal directive still denies them the right to define their own identity.  

            </p>    <h3 style="font-size: 35px; color: red;">An obsolete identity </h3> 
             <p style="font-size: 25px;"> Malai means “hill” in Tamil, while Malaiyaha or Malaiyagam refers to “hill country.” In Sri Lanka, the “Malaiyaha Thamilar” or “Malaiyaha Tamils”  
              are the Hill Country Tamils who were brought from India by British planters to work on coffee and tea plantations. The 200th anniversary of their 
              arrival in Sri Lanka was commemorated by the Malaiyaha Tamils in 2023. It must be underscored that although over 200 years have passed, the squalid living
               conditions, discrimination, and slave-like treatment of this ethnic group remain largely unchanged.  

            </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  While this disadvantaged community makes the news from time to time predominantly due to the issue of their daily wages, they have been making
               numerous appeals to the government to improve their overall living conditions. One of their most recent appeals is to be recognised as the ‘Malaiyaha Tamils’.  

            </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  “‘The Malaiyaha Tamils’ identity was originally given by the British and continues to be classified as ‘Indian Tamil’ to this day. However, the fifth or sixth 
              generation of this community now wants to identify themselves as the ‘Malaiyaha Thamilar’ community,” said Muthulingam Periyasamy, Executive Director of the 
              Institute of Social Development (ISD). He made these remarks at a media briefing held on February 7.  

            </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Periyasamy noted that while some prefer to retain the ‘Indian Tamil’ identity, the majority of the younger generation wishes to be recognised as Malaiyaha Tamils.
               He urged the government— just as they had urged previous administrations—to officially acknowledge this identity. 

            </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  further explained that while the Department of Census and Statistics has begun using the classification “Indian Tamil/Malaiyaha Tamil” for Hill Country Tamils,
               there is a need to remove the reference to India and recognise them solely as “Malaiyaha Tamil”.

            </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;"> “Now, we ask the government: why can’t you issue a circular to all government departments? Even today, when a baby is born, if the parents wish to register the child’s
               race as Malaiyaha Tamil on the birth certificate, officials refuse, citing the absence of an official directive. Instead, they record it as ‘Indian Tamil.’ So we ask the 
               government—why not issue a circular permitting those who wish to register as Malaiyaha Tamils to do so?” Periyasamy said.
