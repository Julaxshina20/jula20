        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;"> Indian identity</h1>
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">

            <p style="font-size: 25px;">  “While all citizens share a common Sri Lankan identity, individuals also have distinct ethnic identities—such as Sinhalese, Muslims, Burghers, and Tamils. 
            When it comes to Tamils in Sri Lanka, they belong to two distinct groups: Sri Lankan Tamils and Indian Tamils, and these two groups cannot be viewed as a
             homogenous community for several reasons,” Gowry Palaniappan, freelance consultant and resource person for national and international organisations, and
              former lecturer of Sociology at the University of Colombo, explained to Daily Mirror.
            
            </p>   <p style="font-size: 25px;">   Going back 200 years to the arrival of Indian Tamils, Palaniappan explained, “During the British period, people from India were brought for various purposes. 
            A structured migration took place under the supervision of a headman called ‘Kangany,’ initially supplying workers for road and harbour construction, followed by 
            plantation labour. Those recruited for plantations were exclusively settled in coffee, tea, and rubber estates, while construction workers were placed both within 
            and outside plantation areas based on demand. Additionally, independent migrants —including traders, money lenders, and craftsmen—settled in both plantation regions
             and urban centres. However, the majority were plantation workers,” she said.  
            
            
            </p>   <p style="font-size: 25px;"> When a group of people resides in a particular geographic area over an extended period, adopting a shared social system, livelihood patterns, cultural practices, 
            and values, they naturally evolve into a distinct community with a unique identity and a sense of belonging to their environment. “The Indian Tamils—particularly 
            those brought for plantation work—have lived in Sri Lanka for over 200 years, losing most of their ties to India. Today, they consider Sri Lanka their home and
             deserve an identity that reflects their reality. From a sociological perspective, the Indian Tamil community’s identification with Sri Lanka is crucial for their future,” she stated.   
            
            
            </p>   <p style="font-size: 25px;"> Retaining the Indian identity may also place this community in a vulnerable position, Palaniappan explained, “It creates a psychological barrier to being on par
             with other communities and fosters an underlying sense of suspicion, especially among neighbouring groups.”  
            
            
            </p>   <p style="font-size: 25px;"> The decision to embrace the term Malaiyaha Tamils instead of Indian Tamils emerged after extensive discussions. As mentioned before, the third, fourth, and even
             fifth generations of these Tamils now live and work in Sri Lanka’s tea, coffee, and rubber plantations, with little to no connection to India. “While no one 
             can deny their origins in southern India, a significant amount of time has passed. Malaiyaha Tamil is a geographical identity that reflects their lived reality,” she said.   
            
            
            </p>   <p style="font-size: 25px;">   At the same time, she acknowledged that a small segment of the community—those who reside outside estates, in towns, or have migrated from plantations—may still maintain
             some ties to India, but emphasised that this group is a minority.   </p>
