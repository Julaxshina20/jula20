                A heated argument erupted in Parliament today when Deputy Minister Mahinda Jayasinghe came up with details on his recent visit to a Buddhist Training Centre in Kelaniya.
                
                The argument came up when Deputy Minister Jayasinghe was allowed to respond to an allegation by MP Dayasiri Jayasekara earlier.
                
                Jayasekara protested, saying that he did not mention the Deputy Minister's name.
                
                Chief Opposition Whip Gayantha Karunatillake who intervened said Jayasekara should be allowed to respond. 
                
                However the MPs settled down a few moments later.
                
                Jayasinghe who revealed that a part of land on which the training centre is constructed has been grabbed by a certain politician and that he had requested the CID to probe into it. </p>
