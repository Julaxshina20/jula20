            <p style="font-size: 25px;"> The tragic deaths of elephants due to train collisions continue to be a major concern, with authorities acknowledging the failure of previous preventive measures.

            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  The latest incident occurred last morning when a herd of elephants were struck by the Meenagaya Intercity Express Train between Gal Oya and Minneriya on the Batticaloa railway line, disrupting train services and inconveniencing commuters.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">   A herd of eight wild elephants crossing the railway line between Gal Oya and Minneriya railway stations had been hit by the Batticaloa bound Meenagaya Express Train last night. The Wildlife Conservation Department claimed that six elephants, including three calves and two female elephants were killed in the accident yesterday, while another female elephant and a calf sustained injuries. The injured animals are currently receiving treatment at the Giritale Wildlife Department, the Wildlife Conservation Department said.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Due to the collision, train operations on the Batticaloa railway line have been affected, causing delays and cancellations for passengers travelling between Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Speaking at a media briefing at the Railways Headquarters, Railway Trade Union Alliance Co-convenor S.P. Vithanage said that train collisions with elephants frequently occur between Polonnaruwa and Higurakgoda. He criticized the lack of effective measures and called for immediate intervention to prevent further incidents.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Vithanage also announced that discussions were held yesterday with the Transport Minister, Wildlife Conservation Department and railway officials to implement long-term solutions that protect both elephants and railway operations.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Meanwhile, a senior railway official claimed that the trainâ€™s engine driver had violated operational guidelines by speeding at night, making it impossible to stop in time. The official also noted that the driver failed to adhere to warning signs along the railway track.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Cabinet Spokesman and Mass Media Minister Nalinda Jayatissa admitted that most previous attempts to prevent human-elephant conflicts and train-related elephant deaths had been unsuccessful.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  "With this latest incident, we are committed to implementing a scientific and sustainable solution that ensures railway operations continue while protecting elephants," he stated.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Experts have identified several elephant corridors along the Batticaloa railway line and proposed technological solutions to mitigate accidents. These include:
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">   * Installing low-frequency horns to warn elephants
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">   * Using infrared detectors to identify elephant movements
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  * Imposing strict speed limits in high-risk areas
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  * Deploying wildlife officers onboard trains
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  A senior Wildlife Department official revealed that 65 elephants have died this year due to various causes, with eight of them killed by trains. Most train-related elephant deaths occur within a 16-kilometre stretch between Minneriya and Gal Oya, where the railway line passes through the Minneriya and Kaudulla nature reserves. A total of 388 elephants died last year, 11 of them due to train accidents, the official said.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  To address this, the Wildlife Department has proposed constructing an elevated railway track in the high-risk zone to prevent further collisions.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  The Railways General Manager said that the train was driven at a speed between 20 kmph and 25 kmph as the train was nearing the Gal Oya train station.
                
            </p> <p style="font-size: 25px;">  There is no information yet on whether the engine driver was under the influence of liquor, but a report on the driver has been requested. </p>
