                <p style="font-size: 25px;"> The Vavuniya High Court has sentenced former Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) Lalith Jayasinghe to four years of rigorous imprisonment for releasing a suspect in connection with the murder of schoolgirl S. Vidya in Punguduthivu in 2015.  

                  </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Judge M.M. Mihar also imposed a fine of Rs. 50,000 on Jayasinghe. Failure to pay the fine will result in an additional six months of imprisonment.  
                    
                  </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Sivaloganathan Vidya, an 18-year-old schoolgirl from Punkudutivu, was abducted, gang-raped and murdered in Jaffna on May 13, 2015, while returning home from school. Residents arrested the main suspect, 'Swiss Kumar,' and handed him over to the police.  
                    
                  </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Jayasinghe, who was arrested on July 15, 2017, by the Criminal Investigation Department, was found guilty of aiding the suspect's escape while in custody. 
                    
                  </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  The High Court judge ruled that the prosecution had proven the allegations beyond reasonable doubts.  
                    
                  </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  In addition, the judge ordered the issuing of open warrants on Sri Gajan, a former Sub-Inspector of the Crime Investigation Division of the Kytes Police, who was also an accused in the case.</p>
