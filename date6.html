            Three suspects including a police constable were arrested over the murder of a 39-year-old man and his 6-year-old daughter in Middeniya this week, Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala said today.
             He told Parliament that the suspects have been identified as Police Constable I.L. Janaka Prasad and the others as Jeewan Prasad Kumara and Prabad Thushara.
             Nine Fundamental Rights petitions filed challenging the appointment of Deshabandu Tennakoon as the Inspector General of Police (IGP) were today fixed for argument by the Supreme Court.

            </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">    The Supreme Court's five-judge bench, comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Yasantha Kodagoda, A.H.M.D. Nawaz, Shiran Goonaratne and Achala Wengappuli, fixed the petitions for argument on May 6, 7 and 8.
             
             The Supreme Court has already issued an interim order restraining Deshabandu Tennakoon from exercising the powers, functions and responsibilities of the office of Inspector General of Police.
            </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">     Police opened fire on a speeding car in the Hokandara area last night, leading to the arrest of a couple involved in smuggling of cannabis.

             Police said officers from the Malabe Police Station signalled the car to stop, but the driver refused and reversed the vehicle. An officer then fired at the car's tyre, causing it to crash on to a light post.
             
              </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  Upon searching the vehicle, police discovered 1.8 kgs of cannabis hidden under the car seat. Police said another 1 kg of cannabis was also recovered following the search of the suspects' home.
             
          The suspects, a 30-year-old man and his 33-year-old wife, residents of Delgoda, were arrested. 
             
             Malabe police are continuing further investigations. </p>
