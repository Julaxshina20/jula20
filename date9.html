        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;"> Pope still in critical condition with signs of ‘mild’ kidney failure, Vatican says <hr> </h1>

        <p style="font-size: 25px;"> <b> CNN - </b>Pope Francis remains in critical condition, according to the Vatican, with blood tests showing mild signs of kidney failure “which is currently under control,” the Vatican said Sunday, as the 88-year-old pontiff battles pneumonia in both his lungs.

          </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;">  It added that Francis, who was hospitalized over a week ago, has not shown further respiratory crises since yesterday evening.
            
          </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;"> Some of his blood tests indicate “an initial, mild, renal failure, which is currently under control,” the Vatican said, adding that the Pope continues to be “vigilant and well oriented.”
            
          </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;"> Francis, who continues to receive oxygen, took part in the Holy Mass from the apartment set up on the 10th floor of Gemelli hospital on Sunday morning, according to the statement. Those taking care of him during his hospitalization also took part.
            
          </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;"> “The complexity of the clinical picture, and the necessary wait for pharmacological therapies to provide some feedback, require that the prognosis remain reserved,” the Vatican said.
            
          </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;"> Earlier on Sunday, the Vatican said Francis had received high flows of oxygen after suffering a respiratory crisis but had a peaceful night in hospital. The Vatican said Francis will remain in hospital following his pneumonia diagnosis in both lungs and did not deliver the weekly Angelus prayer Sunday – for only the third time in his almost 12-year papacy.
            
          </p>  <p style="font-size: 25px;"> The Pope said his treatment continues and thanked medical staff for their dedication in the text of Sunday’s sermon, which was sent to the press in advance. </p>
